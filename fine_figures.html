                            This is George, I love her very much. She is not real unfortunatly and is from a video game. <br> 
                            That makes her a gamer. If she were not so lovely and not such a dear friend, I might never <br>
                            have forgiven her for this. I named her George because at the time I did not yet understand <br> 
                            that cows were female. She provided me with plenty of milk and in return I brushed her every <br> 
                            day. To me, she represents consistency.</p>

                            General Georgy Zhukov was a Soviet general during World War II. He organised the defense of <br>
                            Leningrad, Moscow and Stalingrad. Three major defenses that ultimately defeated the Axis <br>
                            powers. It takes a great man to be able to see such a devastation of your country to the <br> 
                            Axis powers and still fight them back all the way to Berlin. When I feel sad I think of <br> 
                            those trapped in Stalingrad, starving and facing certain defeat. It makes my worries seem trivial!</p>

                            damn cool, she does also look good while doing it. OMG I FORGOT! My favourite thing is that she <br> 
                            has a friend crow named... well... Crow. He can talk and is very mischevious. Everyone needs a <br>
