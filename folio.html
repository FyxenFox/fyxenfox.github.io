                                This is my 3D model of a town hall for a video game. I used architecture in and around Glasgow <br> 
                                for reference and ideas. The overall model is quite low poly (a couple thousand tris) despite <br> 
                                being somewhat detailed. You may notice this if you look more carefully at the curved features. <br> 
                                The straight edges that angle to other straight edges give away the square nature of the model. </p></td>

                                The art gallery model was designed following the style of The Department Store building in <br> 
                                London. It's a very grand building but using simple loop cuts and extruding, the actual <br>
                                model itself was easy. The texturing however was the difficult part. I opted for using real <br>
                                photography of window ornamentation and projected the texture onto the thesurface of the model.  </p>

                                A lovely friend of mine uses her bafflingly awesome Python skills to create a Discord bot that <br>
                                can do just about anything. This bot is named 'Sandpiper'. In her honour I have made a lovely <br> 
                                pub in a video game and given it her names sake. This pub is interesting due to the fact I <br>
                                modelled it entirely in the Source Engine. A most terrible achievement. The lower windows are <br> 
                                3D models I made, using the same projection technique mentioned earlier. </p>

                                The office builing here uses more in-engine modelling due to how these areas inside are entirely <br> 
                                playable areas of the map. The building on the left houses a stairway up to the office building <br>
                                and is loosely based on the King William House in Bristol. The office building itself was <br>
                                designed to invoke a slight industrial feel to represent the types of buildings you may see in <br>
